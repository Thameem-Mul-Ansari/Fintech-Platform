       "\" Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Our show will take questions straight from you, the viewer. Remember if you have a question for us, ask the Com Mount Show at gmail.com. Last week we had Barry Rittholz on the show, the namesake of our firm. Barry had a lot of interesting things to say about writing and producing content and blogging. He's been doing this for a couple of decades now. I mentioned with Barry that I answered questions. When I started my blog, my whole reason for doing it was answering questions for friends and family because I was sick of them asking me because I was the finance investment guy. I tip big at two questions from my high school friends, especially the high school and college friends, text messages. One is should I buy or sell this stock? What should I do with this here? Is this a good buy? Is this a good sell? And two, is this going to get worse? I hear from people way more and things are getting worse. Things right now are getting worse. I have a question. I think our first one we're going to do today is actually from someone who texted me this week, one of my friends. We're going to use that. What do we get here, Duncan? Alright, cool. Before we get started, I just want to say for those who haven't watched, you have to watch the latest animal spirits. It's episode 247. There's a clip in there of Ben scoring a touchdown at what was the stadium? The Silver Dome in Detroit, Michigan, which is not there anymore. I think it's been torn down, but that was the old stadium before they had it. My glory days, I played there a couple times for the state championship. That was like 98, 99. Yeah. Everyone needs to watch that. But first I had a football question for you, which is, I've always wondered when I see you evading tackles in that long run, would you rather see someone coming to tackle you or not know that they're coming? Oh, definitely see them. Okay. The reason I asked is because of the car crash thing, people say, if you tense up, that's when it hurts the most and you get injured the most. So I didn't know if it's preferable to just be tackled and not know. Okay, yeah. I think preparing for one, it's kind of unlike the stock market, right? You'd rather be prepared for a downturn than get hit from the side, right? Okay, cool, cool. I ran cross-country, so we don't tackle. Okay. Okay, so first up, today we have a short and sweet one. Inflation was already out of control. Now the war has made gas prices spike. How does this not end in recession? Yeah, I think this is a question a lot of people are asking these days. And unfortunately, like the odds of a recession are much higher now than they were called two to an F weeks ago. I think you'd have to be pretty dense to not at least think that. It's obviously impossible to predict these things with 100% certainty, but I would almost be surprised if we didn't have some sort of minor economic contraction because of this. And it's not just the US, right? This thing will probably be global, and I'm guessing the US will probably fare the best out of most developed nations. So John thrilled this chart of electricity and natural gas. This is from Michael Sumbleset, JP Morgan. He compares electricity prices and natural gas prices between some countries in Europe and then the US. You can see the spike in Europe is just massive. And they're far more dependent on Russia for some of their commodities. And their prices there were much higher to begin with. It's funny. We're complaining about $4 gas here in the US, but in Europe, people have been paying well over that price for a long time now. They already have a lot more and they do it in leaders. So I can't do the actual conversion in my head, but let's just say it's higher. It is important to note that inflation doesn't always cause a recession, but every inflationary spike in history has only been alleviated by a recession, right? So what happens to get that inflation back down? Unfortunately, every time it's a recession. So let's look at this next chart, John, of inflationary spike. So I looked at every inflationary spike of 5% or more going back to 1940. And you can see the gray bars on this chart show when recession happened. The little red circles I did there was every time inflation spiked above 5%. It's not a perfect relationship in the sense that you can gauge the timing on these things. Sometimes inflation fell, then we went into a recession. The recession occurred during that spike in inflation. And then sometimes that inflationary spike probably didn't have any to do with it, like say the 2008 crisis. That's the last time we had oil this high. That was probably going to happen anyway. But the only way inflation came down in any of these instances was because a recession came afterwards or a recession happened because of this. So I hate to be the bearer bad news, but this is kind of where we're at. So if we pull up this next table, John, this just shows the pre-recession inflationary spike, again, go back to the 40s and then what happened afterwards? We just had our inflation print this morning of 7.9%. That happened before all this stuff with Ukraine and Russia happened, before energy splices, prices spiked, before agricultural commodities, prices spiked. Again, it's hard to see getting out of this situation where we could in the coming months in this year, especially probably see 8, 9. I wouldn't be shocked if we saw 10% inflation print this year, which is really going to freak people out, I think. And so unfortunately, I think that a recession is really on the table and it's probably much higher than 50-50 odds of happening right now. Again, I'd be surprised if it didn't happen. Now, what does this mean for the stock market? I mean, we could actually bottom before it happens because it seems like the scenario where we can see it coming now, it's not quite the same parallel as what we saw in the corona crash where everyone knew the day it happened. Tom Hanks got COVID, NBA shut down. We're going into recession the next day. And so the stock market, it's kind of who knows how hairy and volatile it gets. I guess a lot of it depends on how long the world lasts and how long this commodity spiked lasts. Now, of course, recessions are not great because people lose their jobs. One of the interesting factors going on right now is there are 11.3 million job openings in the US. That's the highest number ever. The highest number, the highest this number ever was pre-pandemic with 7.5 million. So there's more jobs than ever. What do you think a recession happens? People lose their jobs. And obviously, this kind of stat can change overnight if there's a slowdown. But consumers have repaired their balance sheets for years. We've paid down credit card debt, increased savings rates, home equities to the roof for people who are in a home. So if we do have a slowdown, I expect it to be minor, depending on all this shakes out. But I think the odds of a recession are so much higher than now than they were even a month ago. And it's probably going to happen with the caveat that I cannot predict the future. It's crazy how fast things shifted. It was like the war on top of everything that was already going on. It just accelerated. It's kind of the butterfly flapping swings. This is one man decided to do this and the whole world has essentially changed. I think we could see a slowdown. I think it's probably worse in Europe, unfortunately, and it will be here. So yeah. Kind of a downer. But I think a recession is probably coming at some point. Yeah. It seems like that's what people are expecting, too, based on the moves that we're seeing. All right. Let's do the next one. Okay. So up next, we have, I feel like the wealthiest 10% of investors have taken profits during this year's massive sell-off. Where's this money going? Bonds, cash, or just back into Apple, Microsoft, and Google? So the reasonable assumption here is that it must be the wealthy selling stocks because the top 10% owns something like 90% of stocks. Right? So it has to be the wealthy. I'm not so sure of this. It's also kind of hard to gauge these questions because it hurts your brain to think about it. Like, what happens to the money in a sell-off? Is it just because people are selling? And if you think about it, for every buyer, there is a seller. For every seller, there has to be a buyer. So there can be new shares issued. If a company goes public, if there's a SPAC, you know, you have an IPO, you have companies issued stock options. But money essentially disappears during a sell-off, right? Just like it kind of magically appears during a bull market. So put this chart about the tech rec from the FTN here. So they said, this is from the FT this morning, actually. They said $5 trillion in market-level capital that shaved off the NASDAQ. And this is pretty much in the past year or so. If we look at two examples, the next chart of PayPal and Facebook, I refuse to call it a meta still. And Duncan, I'm angry because if I go on wide charts and I type in Facebook, it doesn't come up anymore. I have to type in meta. And I refuse to call it a meta. Yes, I have to acknowledge it. So Facebook went from a high of $1.1 trillion to a little over $500 billion now. So that's half a trillion dollars gone. PayPal is even crazier, I think, from a relative perspective. 362 billion at the top. And again, these numbers are from like last February. It's not that long ago. It's a little over $100 billion now. Just that it's gone. And so that money is just, it's essentially evaporated, which is kind of what happens. So it doesn't take that much selling. All it is is sort of a supply demand thing where people are willing to pay up and you have a gap up in prices and now the gap is going down. And so that money is just going away. So we look at like the flows. Surprisingly in January, it was still pretty strong. So this is from Eddie Ardenny. This is the equity, mutual funds and ETF flows. It was still pretty positive. I'll be mentioning to see if this trails off little and Federer and especially in March. And then we look at the bond flows. Bonds are actually coming down a little bit in January. But the money is still pouring in. Now of course, you have all these different competing investors. You have index phones and equity manage phones and institutions and corporate executives and individual shareholders and hedge phones. So you have all these millions of investors who have different opinions and time horizons and goals and risk profiles and reasons for selling. So it's always kind of hard to know like who's doing the selling and why and what the reason is and who's freaking out. I want to do want to get back to the 10% comment because it seems to make sense again, the 10% sell. But William Bernstein had this piece at the beginning of the pandemic and he used this quote from JP Morgan that said, in bear market stocks return to their rightful owners. And a lot of people have taken that quote from way back in the early 1900s to be like, okay, in bear markets, the people who are patient and disciplined and willing to put money in. Those are the ones we're going to make out, okay. But Bernstein said, yeah, that's great. But guess who has the money in a downturn? Rich people. And so bear markets actually make wealth inequality worse because rich people have the financial means to buy financial assets when they're at depressed prices. And so a lot of people were shaking their fists at the sky and saying, oh, the rich people are getting richer during the pandemic. That's probably going to happen in every bear market in the future as wealth inequality continues to have a separate, you know, between the haves and the have not. So unfortunately, like downturns level of playing field for a little bit in a short run as those holders of financial assets see their prices fall. But they're also buying when they're falling. And so over the long run, that's a positive for rich people. And unfortunately, it probably makes wealth inequality even worse. I know this is, we're kind of on a downer here, Duncan, for the first two recessions. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's going to be a lot worse now. But I think that's how it probably plays out. It'd be nice to think like all the wealthy people are selling their panicking. So that's probably not the case because they have the financial means to actually hold on. Yeah, right. Yeah, they don't have to. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's see if we can get cheered up with the next question. Let's do it. Okay, do you think it's a good idea to use an S block or a down payment on your house if you don't want to sell any stock? Can you first explain what an S block is for new rails like me? Yes. I just have to do the acronyms for you. We're going to have to do like a sheet of all the acronyms for us. So S block is securities based line of credit. So that's like borrowing against your portfolio, taking you can take use of this collateral, borrow against it, or pay a low level of interest and then use that money for something else. So this is really more of a financial planning question than it is an investment question, I think. So let's bring a certified financial planner on here from our firm, Kevin Young, who's in the office with Duncan. He's in an undisclosed location because they can't be against each other. So Kevin, when thinking through something like this, this is a question we've been getting a lot actually. I don't want to take taxes into account and have to sell something and pay taxes on it. But I have this big outlay coming up. When you have to think through something like this from financial planning perspective, what are the main areas of concern or what are some of the variables people think about when taking a load against their portfolio? Yeah, so these lines of credit have become really popular the last couple years. And I think partially people are seeing what's going on with the ultra wealthy. And there was an article in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, maybe a year, 18 months ago talking about, well, how do these people that have so much money pay zero tax? But they're still managing to pull money out of their portfolios. S blocks are half. And the reason you might use one is if you're sitting on some large, appreciated portfolio, the idea is you take the line of credit, call it 3%, and use the money for a down payment as opposed to selling out of the stocks that you own and getting yourself hit with a capital gains tax somewhere between 18 to, could be as high as 30% with state and federal depending on where you live. So that's ultimately why you might do it. I think it can make a lot of sense in the right scenario. You just got to be very careful about how you use the leverage. Because this seems to me like it would be a decent scenario for this. So you want to have it downpaint on the house. You don't want to have to get out of your investments to do it. You're borrowing against your portfolio. You're paying probably a low interest rate. Is this kind of thing make sense? And does the reason for the loan, obviously, if you're leveraging up to buy other stocks or some other risky asset that might not make a lot of sense for a lot of people, but for a down payment where you have the house that's collateral, it seems to make more sense, right? Yeah, it definitely kind of. And again, it's really you're looking at just the spread between the interest rate that you're paying and the returns on the assets that you potentially make as well as the taxes coming into play. So yeah, I think for a down payment for a house, certainly if you're sitting on a large portfolio, it can make a lot of sense to leave those assets in the assets in the portfolio and let them continue to grow. Where you made a great point, it's got to make sense for what you're actually using the money for, right? You're taking money out and putting on an eight leg parlay on draft kings, maybe not the best idea. But certainly for a home purchase, it can be very useful, again, using leverage in the right way can be a good tool. The other thing I want to think about there is the way these loans work is like any other asset you're borrowing against, there's a loan to value ratio that the lender wants to stay below. What's the ceiling there that you'd want to follow? I would say average is probably around 50%, depending on the lender, depending on the assets, I've seen some as high as 70%. Right? So if you have a million dollar portfolio, most places, they'll say we will give you half a million dollars at 3%. Or whatever the interest rate's going to be. The danger then becomes and what the lender is trying to prevent and protect against is that the value of your securities fall, forcing effectively a margin call. And what they'll do is they'll either liquidate positions without needing to ask you to pay themselves back to keep that value the same. Or they'll say, hey, you need to put 10 grand, 20 grand, 30 grand into the portfolio to keep that ratio correct. By the way, go ahead. Parker in the comments says that Kelvin Ridley did not appreciate the parlay comment. That's a good point. Yeah, that was a rough trade for him. However many millions of dollars he is for a year salary. But the last point I wanted to make on this is with that loan to value, if you set something like this up last year and your collateral securities that we're using were Facebook and the ARC complex or tech heavy names. But anything that's gotten crushed. Those are down 30, 40, 50, 60%. If you're in a broad-based, globally diversified equity portfolio, you're probably down eight or 9% year to date. So make sure what you are going to put up as collateral is not going to be something that could potentially draw down 50% in short order. Right. Okay. Done. Done. The next one. Okay. Up next, we have, here's a challenge question for you. This is fun. We all like a challenge, right? I'm 53 and as of January 2022, I had a net worth of $600,000, which was composed of cash, IRA, stocks, and home value minus mortgage. No debt. After the sale of my company, I now find myself with $2 million in cash. A year ago, I would have gone more and more and put 90% in S&P and 10% in bonds. I love to work, but I have the goal of retiring by 60 with at least $5 million in net worth. What in God's name should I do with $2 million in this new economy, full of uncertainty? Great question. And obviously, the value here doesn't matter as much as the thought process of investing in windfall when things seem scary and uncertain. And my one rule of thumb for this is like, obviously, you have to take into account what's going on in the world and where this stock market is and interest rates and all these things, but it's far down the list in terms of setting up a financial investment plan. It's not the first variable. It might not even be in the top five in terms of what's going on in the macro right now. How should this impact what I do with my portfolio? So Kevin, you have a client come to you and they say, listen, here's a certain time horizon. So this person says, you know, in seven years, I want to go from A to B. They're telling you, I want to retire at 60. I want to have this much money. How do you handle a situation like that where they give you like the outcomes that they want to get? And then they say, okay, create a portfolio for me or a financial plan that gets me there? Right. Yeah, I love this question because it allows us to touch on a lot of different concepts in financial planning. You know, ultimately, this is just a math problem, right? This is just a question of assumed rates of returns and what you have and what you're going to contribute to it. If you took the simple math and let's say, let's say that this person, again, wants to get to $5 million in seven years, currently has about $2.6 million in net worth. If they're a regular W2 worker contributing, you know, the max to their 401k, they're going to need a round and 9% annualized rate of return to get to $5 million. That's obviously the tricky part in that we don't know for sure what those rates of return are going to be. So ultimately, you end up with a situation that you have something that is true on a piece of paper in your plan or on a spreadsheet, but the real world obviously comes in a play here. So that's where the variables can be tough to figure out. Right. And I guess if you have that end goal, you can use it to set expectations, right? Like, here's what you need. Here's how this could, here's like your range of outcomes. And then as you get closer and you build a financial plan, you kind of say, all right, we're getting a little closer. Here's what the actual returns are going to be. Here's what you wanted. And sometimes, I guess the good thing is you can tell someone, listen, your expectations are so far out of the lack with reality in the current situation that you're never going to get there. And so you can use that as a conversation starter, maybe you're going to have to put my money in, or maybe you're going to have to work longer, or maybe you're not going to have as much at retirement as you think. So you can use those all as sort of signpost along the way to help them understand their goals. But I like the idea of managing a financial plan and you have this target. And then I guess the other thing is, is that right? I'm sure you have this conversation a lot. Like, when you turn 60 in retire, that doesn't mean your financial plan is done. And then that's like when the hard work begins, right? Yeah, exactly. And one other point on kind of the math side of this is that 9% rate of return, if this guy is saying that he's really uncomfortable right now, 13% off the all time highs, if he had put this money in a year ago, if he can't stick with that 9010, that might not be the portfolio for him. And so that's where the behavioral coaching comes in that I think we can help a lot of people with is, yes, you might need 9%, but if the volatility that we're experiencing now is making you really uncomfortable, and it's going to cause you to do something silly like panic cell or something like that, then we need to kind of marry the rational, right? Which is, okay, you need a 9% rate of return with the reasonable, which is what portfolio and plan can we develop for you that you'll stick with? Because ultimately that's going to be what the biggest driver of success is. And to your point, if we've got, we don't have seven years to make this work. We've got seven years until potentially he's going to start drawing the money. And we've got another 30 years that this money needs to keep up with things like inflation and spending and things like that. And I like to remind people too that this is by far one of the craziest macro environments I've ever seen, especially just with all the really cross trends going on, but you're never 100% certain what it's going to go on. Uncertainty is always at an all time high, I guess. It hits a new high every single day. So it's really hard to know. So that was a great question. So thanks for coming on, Kevin. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Adam. Thank you. This is a really crazy macro environment. I see we've got a bunch of questions here on this side. A lot of people asking about inflation hedges and housing help there. So keep those comments and questions coming. We're always looking for more. Remember, ask the compound show at gmail.com. On that note too, I wanted to mention, if we pull your question from the chat and you see it on a future show, just email us and we'll send you a sticker. Obviously, we can't track you down just from a comment. So if you want to take it. What's the sticker look like, Duncan? Is there any other comments? I think you got one. The compound sticker. This one back here. Yeah. And we're not even selling those, right? We're just giving one. The only way you get it is from having a question selected. It's exclusive. That might be an inflation hedge. Turn it into an NFT, Duncan. It's true. All right. Remember, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Thanks for donating, Kevin, for joining me and we will see you next time. See you. Bye.\""

Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by-go. Yep, yep. This was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. You know, pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools, 401k, Roth IRA, is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate. And also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every other time, right? Those are the pros. The cons, of course, are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is, they're not huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before, that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. I do, we as a firm, advise folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right, I think over the long term, real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this, I think soberly, Ben, I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. The reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on, let's say, 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. And so the taxes are... Well, put in your situation, how do you find tenants every year? So it's rough. And that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work, I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is in that loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it. And you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. So that's a great question for you guys. And I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go and that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasping. So yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house so they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. We go back in the backyard. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They send me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. They like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of like long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? Do I pay it in full and just stop my feet? I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up in that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I... Do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go I for I. Two for two. You take your tree. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. You see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal here. I think you can sell them as lumber. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. All right. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone. Even from the haters who call me Nileetus, I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

       " \" What particular sectors/names do you find most compelling for a young investor with a 35 40 year time horizon? But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk server the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written in as written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. To this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? If this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Little wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic one. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right. Question two, what do we got? Okay. So for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. That is 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more than the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through to have a little more detail. That will get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. So kudos to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowaltman, Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single mail is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this, Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. You got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone with a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self-a favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, grows to $12,000 in 10 years, and then grows to $24,000 in God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past Ednaud'sium called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, whatever. Oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax-free. That's the idea. We gave the money anyway. Why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by-go. Yep, yep. This was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. You know, pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools, 401k, Roth IRA, is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate.

And the other thing is, they're not huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before, that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. I do, we as a firm, advise folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too.

Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. And so the taxes are...

So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it. And you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. So that's a great question for you guys. And I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go and that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasping. So yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house so they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. We go back in the backyard. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They send me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. They like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of like long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? Do I pay it in full and just stop my feet? I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up in that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I... Do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go I for I. Two for two. You take your tree. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. You see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal here. I think you can sell them as lumber. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. All right. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone. Even from the haters who call me Nileetus, I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com.

Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by-go. Yep, yep. This was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. You know, pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools, 401k, Roth IRA, is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate. And also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every other time, right? Those are the pros. The cons, of course, are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is, they're not huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before, that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. I do, we as a firm, advise folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners right, I think over the long term, real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this, I think soberly, Ben, I think correctly identifies the what's going on broadly in the market. The reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on, let's say, 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. And so the taxes are... Well, put in your situation, how do you find tenants every year? So it's rough. And that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work, I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is in that loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it.

       " \" What particular sectors/names do you find most compelling for a young investor with a 35 40 year time horizon? But what's the best way for him to do this? A one time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunk server the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the markets work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the markets. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital in time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Customers Yots. It's one of the best titled books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book ever read ever written in as written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage because I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl. Would it is like to be a wife and a mother? There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by their words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they use to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person and I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this from a psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jagged in their life runs a marathon. You have to ease into it and train and get better. So the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. So I think you can start by asking some questions. To this person, how do you plan on retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year? Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? If this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Little wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in this stock market. Now, if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can't actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to Nick Murray.com. That's M-U-R-R-A-Y because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I haven't read that one yet. It's a classic one. It sounds like what your time is all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put in. Sure, it's able. Yeah, it's how much risk you need to take, how much you want to take, and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person with a decade ahead of them needs to take a little bit more risk. All right. Question two, what do we got? Okay. So for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. That is 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year I will make significantly more than the Roth IRA income limit of $125,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through to have a little more detail. That will get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. So kudos to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at RealTowaltman, Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. Guilty as charged. So I want to start. Single mail is winning the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up. And that's fantastic, given where he is in life. So his question, what do I do with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this, Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. You got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers. Because in recent years, you talked to me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone with a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self-a favor now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule of seven, grows to $12,000 in 10 years, and then grows to $24,000 in God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this taxpayer, this single male is doing this, right? He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past Ednaud'sium called a backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single male, is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if he wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in $6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth, there is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS chief counsel signed off on this about two, three years ago in a conference before then there was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation and the top attorney at the IRS comes out and says, this is cool, that's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, whatever. Oh, sorry, go ahead. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax-free. That's the idea. We gave the money anyway. Why not look to sort of help your future self? Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going by-go. Yep, yep. This was part of the House Wayne's and Means Proposal Committee budget that came out in September. Yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. You know, pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political soap opera going on with the budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools, 401k, Roth IRA, is real estate the next best option. I've always been told the owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this still holds true? If so, is real estate investing still viable option these days with bloated home prices? And then they go and give us the context of who they are. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. You see these big dollar amounts happening in real estate. And also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every other time, right? Those are the pros. The cons, of course, are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for your rental property and your property manager now, and especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is, they're not huge pools of capital coming in here that weren't there before, that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing, active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. I do, we as a firm, advise folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. I'm a client too.

And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on, let's say, 10 years or more, we all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000, right? And he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was a hundred X. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The plumbing had to be replaced. And so the taxes are... Well, put in your situation, how do you find tenants every year? So it's rough. And that means for me putting it out on Craigslist and if that doesn't work, I need to go find a broker, right? And then I owe them a first month's rent that choose into my net operating profit there in year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is in that loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers are not picking up the phone and there's water pouring out over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost unless about other variables like if everyone else is doing it. And you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah. All right. So that's a great question for you guys. And I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They have been communicating with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go and that's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car's getting too much gasping. So yeah. So in May, they told us, we're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees. We're going to bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. Weeks go by. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life miraculously. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house so they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. We go back in the backyard. The new trees are there. Look, gorgeous, beautiful. They never told us. They send me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 worth of trees here. Now, the kids have already gone out and named each tree. They like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of like long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? Do I pay it in full and just stop my feet? I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up in that price. Well, there's a caper issue on the trees based on the number of leaves. So I think I... Do I just suck it up here? These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. Yes. I would go straight biblical. You go I for I. Two for two. You take your tree. You take his and that's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson style. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. You see, you go fix people's toilets in the middle of the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I don't know what to do. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000 of depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. So I think I got a steal here. I think you can sell them as lumber. I was going to say the solution is staring us right in the face, guys. All right. Nice. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone. Even from the haters who call me Nileetus, I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday and who knows will come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week.\"]"

So last but not least, I'm in my 30s and can now afford to buy a house full cash without taking any debt. However, with interest rates so low and they wrote this one a while back, but should I take a loan anyway and finance the house and invest my capital in the stock market? I think this is interesting that rates could change the story. Going from a 3% mortgage rate to a 5% that hurdle changes. So nine months ago, I would have said you'd be nuts to pay full cash now. Maybe it kind of makes sense, but first of all, who does this person for having that amount of money? I don't really live to be able to buy and cash, but that's great. But so Matt, you're thinking through this type of decision with a client. And this is the kind of thing where there really is no right or wrong answer, right?
